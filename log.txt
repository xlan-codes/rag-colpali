================================================================================
QUESTION: What are the production 'Do's' for RAG?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
The production 'Do's' for RAG, as outlined in the context, are:

1. Start simple and iterate based on metrics.
2. Use metadata filtering for product, language, and permissions.
3. Combine vector search with keyword search using a hybrid approach.
4. Monitor retrieval quality using metrics like recall@k and precision.
5. Keep embeddings synchronized with documents.
6. Evaluate RAG with domain-specific questions to ensure effectiveness.

These practices are essential for effectively implementing and utilizing Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability without the need for retraining models. These guidelines help in improving the performance and reliability of RAG systems in various applications.

QUESTION: What is the difference between standard retrieval and the ColPali approach?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
Standard retrieval typically involves querying a database or system for information based on the provided keywords or criteria. In contrast, the ColPali approach, as mentioned in the document, utilizes a more advanced method involving a combination of components like PaliGemma-3B Vision Language Model, patch embeddings per page, and ColBERT late interaction matching. This approach breaks down queries into different parts, routes them to relevant sources like internal databases or web search based on detected keywords, and synthesizes results from various sources. It also involves query routing, query decomposition, self-correction, and interaction matching to provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to user queries.

Therefore, the key differences between standard retrieval and the ColPali approach lie in the complexity of the process, the use of advanced models and components like vision language models and late interaction matching, as well as the ability to route queries to different sources based on context and keywords detected, leading to a more tailored and multi-faceted retrieval approach compared to traditional methods.

TEST QUESTION 3/3

================================================================================
QUESTION: Why is hybrid search better than vector-only search?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
Hybrid search is considered better than vector-only search for several reasons as highlighted in the provided information:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: While vector-only search misses exact matches and acronyms, hybrid search combines both vector and keyword search to enhance retrieval accuracy and semantic understanding. This is important in scenarios where precise matches are crucial (Document 1).

2. **Improved Performance**: In a benchmark study, hybrid search outperformed vector-only search with a significant increase in NDCG@3 scores. The hybrid approach, especially when combined with a reranker in a 2-stage architecture, demonstrated higher performance and a reduction in retrieval failures compared to vector-only methods (Document 1).

3. **Contextual Relevance**: Hybrid search allows for a more nuanced understanding of queries that span multiple sources and have varying levels of complexity. This makes it more suitable for scenarios where the context of the search queries is diverse and requires a combination of approaches for accurate retrieval (Document 1).

4. **Combining Strengths**: By combining the strengths of both vector and keyword search approaches, hybrid search can leverage the advantages of each method while mitigating their individual limitations. This hybrid approach offers a more robust and versatile search capability, especially in scenarios where a single method may not suffice (Document 2).

In summary, hybrid search is preferred over vector-only search due to its enhanced semantic understanding, improved performance metrics, contextual relevance, and the ability to leverage the strengths of multiple search approaches for more effective information retrieval.
